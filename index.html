	<IMG src ='https://www.ecb.torontomu.ca/~elf/abacus/images/abacus-640x319.JPG'height='200'></div><p><ol><li><b>Orient your abacus properly.</b> Each column in the top row should have one or two beads per row, while each column in the bottom row should have four. When you start, all of the beads should be up in the top row, and down in the bottom row. The beads in the top row represent the number value 5 and each bead in the bottom row represents the number value 1.[1]</li>
	<li><b>Assign each column a place value.</b> As on a modern calculator, each column of beads represents a "place" value from which you build a numeral. So, the farthest column on the right would be the "ones" place (1-9), the second farthest the "tens" place (10-99), the third farthest the hundreds (100-999), and so on.[2]<br>
You can also assign some columns to be decimal places if necessary.<br>
For example, if you are representing a number like 10.5, then the furthest right column would be the tenths place (the first decimal place), the second column would be the ones place, and the third column the tens place.<br>
Likewise, to represent a number like 10.25, the furthest right column would be the hundredths place, the second column would be the tenths place, the third the ones place, and the fourth the tens place.<br></li>
<li><b>Start counting with the beads in the lower row. </b>To count a digit, push one bead to the "up" position. "One" would be represented by pushing a single bead from the bottom row in the farthest column on the right to the "up" position, "two" by pushing two, etc.[3]<br>
You'll find it easiest to use your thumb to move the beads in the bottom row, and your index finger to move the beads in the top row.<br></li>
	<li><b>Complete the "4/5 exchange.</b>Since there are only four beads on the bottom row, to go from "four" to "five," you push the bead on the top row to the "down" position and push all four beads from the bottom row down. The abacus at this position is correctly read "five." To count "six," push one bead from the bottom row up, so the bead in the top row is down (representing a value of 5) and one bead from the bottom row is up.[4]
		</li>
		<li><b>Repeat the pattern for higher numbers.</b> The process is essentially the same across the abacus. Go from "nine," in which all the beads in the ones place are pushed up and the bead in the top row is pushed down, to "ten," in which a single bead from the bottom row of the tens place is pushed up (while the beads in the ones place are pushed back to their starting or "0" position).<br>
For example, 11 would have one bead in the second column pushed up, and another in the first column pushed up, all on the bottom row. Twelve would have one in the second column and two in the first column, all pushed up, and all on the bottom row.<br>
Two hundred and twenty six would have two in the third column pushed up in the bottom row, and two in the second column pushed up in the bottom row. In the first column, one bead on the bottom row would be pushed up, and the bead on the top row would be pushed down.<br></li>
</Ol></li>
<li><ol><li><h1 align='center' >learn Abacus CH-2</h1><b>Input your first number. </B>Say you've got to add 1234 and 5678. Enter 1234 on the abacus by pushing up four beads in the ones place, three in the tens place, two in the hundreds place, and one in the thousands place.[5]</li>
<li><b>Start adding from the left.</b> The first numbers you'll add are the 1 and the 5 from the thousands place, in this case moving the single bead from the top row of that column down to add the 5, and leaving the lower bead up for a total of 6. Likewise, to add 6 in the hundreds place, move the top bead in the hundreds place down and one bead from the bottom row up to get a total of 8.[6]</li>
<Li><b>Complete an exchange. </B>Since adding the two numbers in the tens place will result in 10, you'll carry over a 1 to the hundred place, making it a 9 in that column. Next, put all the beads down in the tens place, leaving it zero.<br>
In the ones column, you'll do essentially the same thing. Eight plus 4 equals 12, so you'll carry the one over to the tens place, making it 1. This leaves you with 2 in the ones place.</li><br>
	<li><b>Count your beads to get the answer.</b> You're left with a 6 in the thousands column, a 9 in the hundreds, a 1 in the tens, and a 2 in the ones: 1,234 + 5,678 = 6,912.</li>
		<Li><b>Step 5 Subtract...5
Subtract by doing the addition process in reverse.</b> Borrow digits from the previous column instead of carrying them over. Say you're subtracting 867 from 932. After entering 932 into the abacus, start subtracting column-by-column starting on your left.[7]<br>
Eight from nine is one, so you'll leave a single bead up in the hundreds place.<br>
In the tens place, you can't subtract 6 from 3, so you'll borrow the 1 in the hundreds place (leaving it zero) and subtract 6 from 13, making it 7 in the tens place (the upper bead up and two lower<br> beads).<br>
Do the same thing in the ones place, "borrowing" a bead from the tens place (making it 6) to subtract 7 from 12 instead of 2.<br>
There should be a 5 in the ones column: 932 - 867 = 65.<br></li></ol></li></body></html>
